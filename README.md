# Unity-Camera-Follow
## Fully customisable camera follow C# script for unity

Easily customizable camera follow system for a 3D platformer for the Unity Engine. Features hard and soft follow zones for follow target, an independent virtual camera with its own follow parameters that controll dead zones for height follow, and a radius and follow speed to the camera rig.

The system makes use of Unity's Cinemachine package for a simple 'look at target' behaviours that included dead, soft and hard zones.It is fully customizable, as parameters are made visible to the Editor using Serialize Fields and other Unity editor tags.
